# AI-ZYPHER-24-DS-Hackathon
This repository contains the work done during Zypher Datathon, where we analyzed rental bike usage data in Seoul (2017-2018). The dataset includes factors such as seasons, time of day, temperature, humidity, rainfall, snowfall, and more, helping businesses predict rental demand patterns and optimize last-mile connectivity.
